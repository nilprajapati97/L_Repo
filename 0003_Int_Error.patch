 $ Errors in C
 
 	1.Compile Time Errors
 	2.Runtime Errors
 	
1.Compile Time Errors
	pre processor
		missed for headerfile stdio.h
		  
	Translator
		synctatical error 
			{,
			semicollon missing
			
	Linker 	
 	   Predefine function -: strlen
 	   Userdefined function -: 
 	   
 	   
 	   
 	   
 	  int my_func(int , int); => prototype
 
          my_function(23);
          
          not defined
 
 
 2. Runtime Error
 
 1.segmentation fault
 	- When a program attempts to access memory location  that is not allowed to access(Un authorised memory access)
	Ex. Lower order memory access
	    trying to change constant data	
	
 2. BUs error	 
 	Hardware related errors
 	Memory not in HW but we are trying to aceess
 	
3 Floating point Exception
  devide by zero
  Infinite are not possible .
